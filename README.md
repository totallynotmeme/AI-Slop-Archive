# The AI slop archive

This place contains (will contain) the worst generative AI code to ever exist. Any code you submit here must be fully AI generated and must be terrible. Human written comments and context are allowed

I've mostly made this repo for myself, but if you want to take a look or contribute, go ahead!

(be aware that scripts here might work badly or not work at all. i am not responsible for any brain damage caused by trying to read or understand code in this place. proceed at your own risk)
